## Introduction:
  This project demonstrates a simple, yet powerful Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for a static website using GitHub Actions and AWS S3. The aim of this 
  project is to automate the deployment process of a static website hosted on AWS S3 whenever code is pushed to the main branch of a GitHub repository.

 By leveraging the native integration of GitHub Actions with AWS, this setup streamlines the deployment process, ensuring that the latest version of the website is always up-to-date and 
 accessible via the internet. It is designed to be lightweight, cost-effective, and scalable, utilizing S3's static website hosting capabilities.
